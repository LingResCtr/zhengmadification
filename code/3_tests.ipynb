    "In principle, we should check for strings with more than 100 possible numbers after the '-', since (in the case of '^br') we can easily find 70 or more characters assigned to a given a code.  But these \"large\" variants seem confined to codes preceded by '^', and the collection of '^' codes seems already to duplicate items also assigned to other \"regular\" (not '-'-initial) codes.  So for practical purposes, we'll consider only the \"augmented codes\" above."

    "* Where you see a `'-'` followed by a number in a ZM code, that's something I had to insert.  There are codes where a single ZM code represents two or more different Chinese characters.  To make sure I didn't overwrite a previous correspondence while gathering the data, I added `'-'` and a number to any ZM code that was already in the database and had a Chinese character assigned.\n",
    "\t* In short, treat ZM codes with `'-'` followed by a number as if they didn't have them: e.g. `'yi-1'` and `'yi'` are the *same code*.\n",
    "* I've **boldfaced** the specific ZM codes that Le and Qifan have already used in the quote.\n",
    "* I've numbered the characters in our quote from 0 to 7, so that we could keep track of them in the data table.\n",
    "\t* If you focus on a specific column, you can look for 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 in order and verify that each database represented here does in fact contain all the characters.\n",
    "* You can also see that **no database (column) _uniquely_ assigns one code to one character**.\n",
    "\t* In each database, each character appears at least twice (... except for 也 (3, 7) and 习 (4) in the RIME database).  That means at least two codes can represent the same character: e.g. `'pdw'` and `'wpd'` both represent 近 (2).\n",

    "Eric, Le, and Qifan suggest the following possible resolution to the issues raised above:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since we make and assign our oligomers manually, it is easy to make the strand represent only \"pdw\" and \"bdrw\" and never \"wpd\" or \"wbrd.\" Therefore, the input should be unique, and the program does not need to distinguish between two codes that represent the same Chinese character. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some thoughts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ZM encoding *as a whole*... I think... *needs* to allow both `pdw` and `bdrw`... as well as `wpd` and `wbrd`.  They're all in the database for a reason.  Specifically, the codes derive from analyzing a given Chinese character into a collection of basic shapes, the so-called *primary* (and perhaps *secondary*) *roots*.\n",
    "    * Sometimes the order of decomposition is ambiguous, and the rules I've encountered so far do not seem always to stipulate priority.  So some characters will be able to be decomposed in multiple ways.  To assist the typist, who at times does this decomposition on the fly, the ZM encoding tries to accept a variety of decomposition orders.\n",
    "        * So in a sense, we can't \"eliminate\" or \"omit\" any particular codes for a given character.  Otherwise we won't be representing ZM.  ZM has this ambiguity built in.\n",
    "            * You'll note that the difference between `bdrw` and `wbrd` can't be one of a \"shortcut\".  And it's no accident that one is a permutation of the other: that's the ambiguity of the decomposition order.  I think that, in part, this comes from ambiguity as to when to write the lines on the left and bottom of the character.\n",
    "        * Perhaps this means my idea earlier of \"using the longest code\" or similar heuristics for *en*coding might be in error.  If we do that, we're removing by fiat some of the ambiguity that the authors of the ZM encoding built into the system.\n",
    "    * Side note: this is **different** from the situation in 4-corner codes.  That system looks only at the shapes that appear in the 4 corners of a character.  Because visual elements recur in Chinese characters, the set of necessary shapes is small.  And the assignment of a code to a character is unambiguous, largely because the process of assessing shapes doesn't require further analysis or decomposition.  However, also due to the recurrence of shapes, *many* characters will get assigned to the same code; so reversing the process for decoding becomes quite ambiguous without additional context.\n",
    "        * Evidently with the ZM method, we have ambiguity in *both* directions.  But it seems like, on an intuitive level, that ambiguity might be \"bigger\" in the *en*coding phase.\n",
    "* But in our case, in a sense, **we are the typist**.  So we get to **choose the code we want to use to represent a character**.\n",
    "    * So perhaps it's **OK after all** for us to say that, given 近 (2) we'll only write `pdw` and never `wpd`, and likewise given 远 (6) we'll only write `bdrw` and never `wbrd`.\n",
    "    * Then we'd only have the ambiguity for *de*coding of `yi` corresponding to 也 or 那些, and we omit strings of more than one character.\n",
    "* Well, maybe it's not so easy.\n",
    "    * Perhaps there are **two approaches to rendering an encoding**.\n",
    "        * **We're the typist.**\n",
    "        * **We might be implementing an encoding as a whole.**\n",
    "    * Sometimes these are the same thing, sometimes not.\n",
    "        * It seems like in the 4-corner codes, being able to encode any given character is the same as implementing the 4-corner system as a whole.\n",
    "        * In the ZM scenario, we could encode any given character without ever implmenting the whole ZM encoding.\n",
    "            * For example, we could always decide we're going to encode 性 as `umc` instead of `um`.\n",
    "                * As a typist, we're free to always prefer `umc` to `um`.\n",
    "                * But if we're trying to encode ZM as a whole, we need have a map between input and storage that allows a typist to use **either `umc` or `um`**.\n",
    "                    * Maybe the latter is what we can say we're doing (implicitly) in this project (in general), but in *this particular quote* we have to make the typist's choice of which code to use."
