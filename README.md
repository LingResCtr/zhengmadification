A collection of Jupyter Notebooks and Python files to explore the Zheng Ma Chinese character encoding system and its implications for script encoding with oligourethanes

Here you'll find the collection of computational materials accompanying the paper...

The structure of this repository is as follows:

* **Code:** a collection of Jupyter Notebooks outlining the development and functionality of the scripts associated with this project.  This also contains a Python module extracting the functions relevant to the data processing and project functionality.
* **Raw:** the original data files collected from different projects on the Internet that contain code and character correspondences for the Zheng Ma system of Chinese character encoding.
* **Img:** some scattered images that were part of the project workflow.
* **Drafts:** unedited earlier versions of the materials collected in the Code folder.
* **Data:** general formats, as well as Python pickles, for data in intermediate stages of processing for the project workflow.
